# Simple Blackjack
### By: Christopher DeMaria

## Overview 
This repository documents a project I worked on during my CSC 212 class at the University of Rhode Island.
- 'Blackjack.cpp' The main portion of the code
- 'Blackjack.h' The file that stores all of the class data
- 'main.cpp' The file that actually runs the blackjack game
