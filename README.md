# Simple Blackjack
### By: Christopher DeMaria

## Overview 
This repository documents a project I worked on during my CSC 212 class at the University of Rhode Island.
- 'Blackjack.cpp' The main portion of the code
- 'Blackjack.h' The file that stores all of the class data
- 'main.cpp' The file that actually runs the blackjack game

## How to Play 
This is a single player version of Blackjack where you face off against an AI.
- The player and the AI are given one random card each at the start of the game.
- The player starts off with $100, and is able to place a bet at the start of the game.
- The player is able to choose to either stand or hit after the game starts.
- The player must try to get to 21 or as close as possible without letting the AI do the same.
